    I am not interested in the theory of Vedanta or the theory of
    God-realization. I only want to know how to live in this world
    with composure, clarity, freedom and effectiveness as an
    individual and as a universal man, accommodating different
    types of interactions and enabling effective performance under
    all circumstances. If spirituality does not have a relevance to
    these, I think I have no need for it.
